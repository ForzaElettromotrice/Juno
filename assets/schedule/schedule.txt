    1. Defined project specifics:
        1.1. Three game modes -> JUno standard (piling and challenge(?), JUno Trade (7 and 0 have special uses)
                and JUno Reflex (jump in and infinite draw).
        1.2. We will use JavaFX for the GUI and MVC, so the project will be divided in three phases:
                model, controller and view.

    2. Started to program the model:
        2.1. User class -> player profile. It has 5 private fields: String nickname, String avatar, int victories,
                int defeats and final Level level. Each field has a getter and a setter; in addiction there are
                the getTotalMatches method (victories+defeats), the load and save methods (save/load profile
                specifics on a txt document when the game is opened/closed) and the addVictories and
                addDefeats methods (used by save and load).
        2.2. Level class -> an object that manages itself level and exp. It has 2 private fields: int level and
                long exp. Each field has a getter and a setter; in addiction there are the addExp method (which
                also converts exp in levels) and the save and load methods (used by the User class).
        2.3. Created the user.txt document which will contain the profile specifics.

TODO:
    1. Implement User contructor
    2. Implement getLevel method in User class
    3. Implement setLevel method in User class
    4. Implement load and save in User class
    5. Implement addExp method in Level class
    6. Implement load and save in Level class
